Great product easy to use, cheap for the price shown
This laptop has exceeded my expectations. It is very fast and easy to navigate. I use it for my college classes and it is a perfect fit for my fast paced lifestyle.
nice product..but more rate compared to apple store.
I absolutely love this computer. It is fast and very dependable. The new force touch is awesome. This is my first MacBook Pro and I'm completely in love. Within minutes of unpackaging this computer I was surfing th web. Simplicity at its finest!! Well done Apple, well done......
Great high powered laptop very light and fast my daughter uses it for School hopefully it will last through college.
I've been a Windows/PC users for may years and never thought of getting a Macbook until I bought this 2015 MBP. I loaded windows 8.1 and it runs super fast. So, getting a Macbook is like getting the best of both worlds.
This is exactly what we needed. We finally left the PC and got a Mac. We thought it would be a difficult transition but it was easy.
Apple has done a great job with the MacBook Pro line but they continue to keep the price relatively high compared to other PC vendors. This model has multiple USB 3.0 ports and Thunderbolt ports for using external medium. There is also a SD cart slot that can be used for uploading of digital photos or what not but I use it for additional storage with a flush mount SD card with 128GB of storage. This is in addition to the 128GB SSD drive already built into the machine which cannot be upgraded. As for the exterior, Apple has created a very slim profile device that feels comfortable to work with while portable or using in an office environment. The keyboard feels very nice and the new Force Touch keyboard is very easy to learn. OS X Yosemite is very functional and works great with this hardware and shows no lag. I don't do very intensive things such as video encoding so I'm not sure how well it would run in that setting.
Beautiful and sleek, the all new MacBook Pro with retina display is just amazing. The flash storage makes it lightning quick and as a traditional MS Windows user, this is a major upgrade.
This is an aesthetically well designed machine and work well and efficiently. It is very easy to carry and very light
I have the previous Retina MacBook Pro models and a lot more Apple Products as I am a huge Apple fan, and this is an amazing laptop.
i love my mac book pro 2015 its fast light and new
A powerful laptop, reasonable price. This is the lastest model and cheaper than apple store. Strongly recommend.
I have always wanted to switch over to mac but didn't want to spend the money. This computer went on sale and I knew it was time. Got a great deal. It's worth the high price tag. Everything operates more smoothly and efficiently. Very user friendly. The track pad is very efficient. Great feedback with no lag time. Definitely do not regret my purchase. Can't see myself going back to a PC for a Loooonnnggg time.
New generation processor and battery make it a long using time.
bought this for the wife. it's the first apple product in our home. she was tired of windows so we gave this a shot. its sufficient for what she needs it for and the screen is beautiful.
My girlfriend is a big Apple lover and she wanted this laptop and it turned out to be everything g she needed and more!
"Not just because a Apple Fan, but mac always never have any problems with receiving viruses compared to pc. It rarely freezes or crashes like the pc, and you are able to use it smoothly.
Buying the retina is worth the couple hundred dollars, compared to a nonretina version. Rather buy the macbook pro retina compared to the price of the new macbook."
"I bought my first MacBook Pro in summer of 2009 and it has lasted me faithfully since then. In the past year, it's started to lag a bit and freeze up more often so it was time for an upgrade. I knew I wanted a Retina screen and since the Airs do not have them, I went for the Pro which are only about .5 lbs heavier than the Air.

I love the purchase; the technology has changed so much since I first bought the MacBook that I do feel like I'm getting a brand new laptop with significant updates from the SSD to the Force Touch, and especially the Retina screen! Worth every dollar -- especially when it's on sale like it was when I bought it! Under $1000 out the door."
Super fast! Everything from connectivity to accessing programs. I'm a believer.
"We switched our entire home computing system after our old pc desktop was 8+ yrs old and pc laptop was 6 yrs old. Had been fairly skepetical of the Apple fanboy nature of reviews, but were tied of our systems crashing all the time. Wife had an iPhone and iPad and we loved the simplicity of the airport extreme router we had. We thought it might be nice to have a Mac environment despite the higher cost. Bought this plus a 21.5"" Mac desktop and a 2tb time capsule all at the same time and have been very pleased.

This laptop is very responsive, beautiful, and easy to set up learn for a newbie. Love how fast it is too. Just took it on a trip overseas and was incredibly light with a Great battery life. Only got the 128 SSD because a have tha time capsule at home. We have only scratched the surface of this machine, but pleased. Highly recommend making the switch."
I was a bit apprehensive about making the jump from a PC to a Mac but I cannot even explain or begin to tell you how satisfied I am with the switch! I've had the computer for about a month, to a month and a half now and I give it a A+. The Mac interface is easy to adjust to and get a feel for. iMessage is an amazing feature if you have an iPhone as well! I look forward to many years of use out of the Mac. Battery life is very good as well!
Only reason for the 4 star is that the 128 is not a good choice for me. Took it back for the 256 GB. If you plan on installing a few programs, storing photos/videos from the iPhone on your laptop instead of in the cloud, you need at least a 256. The 128 will fill up too fast. This is probably why the 8/128GB configuration is on significant sale.
"As an avid Mac user and Apple fan, I always meet the yearly updates with a bit of skepticism. I'd planned on getting the new MacBook as an upgrade to my MacBook Pro (2011), but was sad to check out the specs. It's far too costly of a machine for such poor performance! So, I decided to go with the MBP with Retina instead.

This MacBook with Retina (2015) has exceeded all my expectations. The sharpness of images, processing speed and new Touchpad are worth the investment. Even better, I was able to get mine at $200 off at BB. Check it out! You won't regret it!"
I bought my first MacBook Pro in 2005 and it actually is still alive and kicking. They are just built to last. This model is light, doesn't get hot to the touch, and isn't noisy at all. I thought I'd miss having a huge internal hard drive but I picked up a portable 2TB external hard drive and it's a perfect set up. I also thought I'd miss having an DVD optical drive. Nope. The retina display is beautiful. I've watched 1080p quality movies on it and they look fantastic. I use it mainly for school and its size and weight make it very portable, yet it still packs a punch. Buy it!
Sometimes can't connect to Internet or won't turn on
I wanted the 15 inch but it was not affordable for me, I still totally love this one!
"13"" macbook pro is def the best laptop you can buy right now. not disappointed at all in my purchase. everything feels fasts, retina display is awesome."
The retina display is crisp and absolutely a pleasure to work with. It is also very accurate in color reproduction making it ideal for photo and video editing. The battery works as advertised &lt;9-10 hrs depending on usage and wifi/bt. The force touch feels like you're clicking but its just a taptic feedback from a vibrating motor. So far I haven't really used the press and hold feature for anything. It does feel nice and you can click anywhere on the trackpad but it's not a necessary feature nor is worth upgrading from a 2014 model for this feature. The SSD is insanely fast due to the NVMexpress protocol resulting in write at ~650MB/s and read speeds at ~1300MB/s. All applications load up fast and there is no GUI lag. 8GB is plenty for normal consumption/usage for my particular needs. The SSD is only 128GB which is not that much but since I only store documents, pictures and music it is not an issue for me. I purchased it when it was on sale and used a mover's coupon bringing it less than $1000 which was about $300 cheaper than Apple.
This is truly a powerful little beast. With this macbook pro you can connect two 4k external monitors its extremely fast and is an awesome computer if you're new to Apple this is the computer i'd recommend. This computer will handle what most people through at it.
This is my first Macbook or any apple computer I have owned. I always hated how expensive they where but now I can see why, this laptop is awesome! Macbook pro is super fast and battery last me 10-12 hours on regular use. I would recommend to anyone looking for a laptop to last a whole day that is also super fast.
Upgraded from macbook pro 2012, screen is amazing, speed is as fast as instand ( 4 seconds boot up which i love) . I use parrallel to run windows sometimes, but still flawless speed, even better then a windows machine itself
Great 4k TV, gives dynamic sound allowing me to enjoy my vast sonos sound system.
"In simple words i ave no idea why i kept using windows till now :(
the best part is it takes 4 seconds to boot up and ready to go. Lovin it...!!!"
Retina clear screen, perfect os, very good design, recomended for everyone.
I have delayed for many years spending this much on a laptop. After finally giving up on my last cheap windows laptop I decided to give this a try. Wow.. The difference in quality is outstanding and everything just works. Plenty of processing power and fit / finish is second to none.
This updated macbook is great. The retina display is bright and a treat to look at. The updated processor and RAM make it zing. The new trackpad is a pleasure. All in all, I would highly recommend it. I had a macbook air and actually enjoy this pro quite a bit more. I would recommend upgrading to a 256 hard drive.
"I bought this Macbook for my wife. I already owned a 15"" Macbook Pro and got the 13"" for her because she preferred that size. Great laptop with a wonderful display."
I bought my MacBook Air today and have used it for 6 hours and I am already in love with it! Very easy to use and I love that I can sync my iPhone w/my MacBook via ICloud. I am so glad I made the decision to grab one of these. It's definitely worth the price.
I was hesitant about purchasing this Computer due to the the price, but after multiple Windows computer over the past decade, I could have paid for this long time ago. This computer surprised me with the durability of the all day use without being tethered to a power cord. The Window Migration was seamless. If you are in the hunt for a good computer, Don't look any further. This computer will meet any demands or needs......
I got the lower end because I'll spend most the time connected to a HDTV doing basic things. This computer has a small solid state hard drive which is fine because you can get a large external drive via USB 3.0/Thunderbolt and get great read/write speeds. Screen is very sharp although small than my 27-inch imac and 17-inch MacBook Pro. I will say everything is very snappy with the SSD, quick boot times, etc. Great purchase. If you need a CD drive you can get a cheap 30 dollar one vs the super drive.
I love my new Macbook. It is very slim and lightweight. Super fast processing speeds. Coming from using windows only laptops, I was worried about the change, but I could not be more pleased with my purchase. Apple is worth the money. I will not but another brand now.
Blazing speed, a new touchpad and super-long battery life, puts the updated 13-inch MacBook Pro in a class of its own. Very happy with this purchase!
One of the best laptops money can buy. Build quality is second to non.
I would recommend this computer to everyone .... :)
It is light weight, long long lasting battery, so quick response!
Great laptop. This device is definitely worth the money. I have had dell laptops in the past. the Mac is easier to navigate. It is nice not having to remember to run scanDisk or defriend.
The MacBook Pro Retina (2015) is a wonderful machine. I couldn't be more pleased with its functionality, smoothness, and just overall beauty. From the outside, it just looks premium (as it should, for being $1300). Yosemite runs so well on this machine without any stuttering or flinching. I still can't believe that Apple has created such a perfect laptop. Okay, I'll stop gawking now.
In the past I have always had terrible experiences with other brands. They would quickly slow down, freeze, and get viruses, and were confusing. This computer is truly amazing. The battery life is incredible, the screen is gorgeous, and I have never felt the need to raise the volume to the max. The sound quality is exceptional, and its very loud. I have never, in my life, experienced performance like this. My old computer, and laptops would take sometimes up to 5 minutes to boot. With this, it is literally 10 seconds, and even less to shut it down. I can do a million and one things and this computer never fails. It is so quick. Everything is simple, well thought out, and laid out perfectly. Also, the retina display is remarkable, and the new trackpad still boggles my mind, because it feels exactly like an actual clicker, but when you shut the computer down, it is a flat, stiff surface. All in all the macbook pro(2015) is, in my opinion the best laptop money can buy. It was pricey, but it sure makes up for it when it puts a smile on my face every day when I think about what I used to have to put up with. Do not bother even looking at any other brand, some are just as expensive, but are of inferior quality, and will not last or ever be nearly as good as this.
Retina Macbook, best battery life yet, great display what we come to expect from Apple for a reasonable price
this is my first mac and not my last i initially bought the air but decided to get the pro instead . this computer is the best i can't believe how fast it is with the 8gb ram and PCIe ssd ! the retina screen is amazing i have never seen such a great screen on a laptop . The fit and finish is what you would expect from a apple device . in closing i am very happy with my purchase and can't believe it took me this long to get one .
Purchased this laptop about two weeks ago. So far it has been easy to use, fast working, and the new track pad is nice. Not my first Apple laptop, previously I had a ibook. Would highly recommend for any person looking for a mid level laptop.
My friend has a MacBook Air, and through using his along with my IPhone 6 Plus, I have come to really like Apple products. I bought this one and it is much faster than my friend's MacBook Air. Larger processor. Better visual quality and user friendly!! Load up time is fast! Love my MacBook Pro!!! Will never go back to Windows!!!
Simple, reliable, durable, lightweight, and a very powerful machine. If you're in the market for getting a new laptop, you won't regret getting this one. It has a hefty price tag, but you get what you pay for and this is in it for the long haul. I've never once had a problem with any of my Macs and it's why I continue to invest in Apple's products.
I bought this Macbook a week ago. I can already tell that the money was worth spending! The macbook is so fast! I had a 2011 macbook before and compared to this 2015 model, the old one was slow as a snail! 2015 is seriously one of the fastest laptops I ever used! I am so happy with this purchase. No problems with it at all! Well one thing is I don't like Yosemite, but that is just me and it's a personal issue. No problems with the hardware at all though. The new trackpad is amazing! I love the new 2015 MacBook!
The computer is easy to use, versatile and the dislay is awesome. I plan on working with this as a tool in my classroom for courses like Personal Finance. It is fast and ready to work hard when I am.
Service was great and employees were friendly and knowledgeable
Just converted to a Mac and I am now a Mac lover for life!
My macbook pro has the greatest battery life I have seen in any of my past or present devices! THe computer is really snappy and quick and the forcetouch ability is AMAZING!! I should have switched from my toshiba satellite to a mac a long time ago! The macbook pro is a dream that I hope I never wake up from!
So I am upgrading from the hard drive version and there is no comparison with the pcie flash. Even though I only get 128G of HD, the speed is worth it.
I only bought a new MacBook because I wanted to give my older one to my son. He will be able to use it for a long time, and it has much ability to expand the hard drive, RAM, etc. Great product, no problems.
Best entry option for Apple laptops. Better display than an Air and entry MacBook Pro w/o retina and more processing power than the new Macbook. There are other laptops out there but if you are not a PC fanboy, or wanting to choose the Apple route, this is the best option.
Sleek and gorgeous. The new trackpad is amazing and well built. I have owned every Macbook on the market or used them all and this is my favorite. The battery life on this is phenomenal, which is very close to the Air. I love this machine!
Nothing bad to report on this model! Battery life is extended by one hour, making it 10 hours long now. The force track pad is pretty cool, almost an optical illusion that it actually goes down like a button but it doesn't. Def worth the purchase if you haven't purchased a macbook within 3-5 years. Must buy if you don't have a macbook pro at all!
This computer is super fast and sleek. The force touch trackpad is very interesting to use, and it's nice to not have a moving part in it. The screen is very crisp and this computer leaves nothing left to be wanted! If you are looking for a new Mac laptop then this is it!
"Worth every pennie I pay for it.
More than I expect"
The best laptop on the world for business or personal use you can buy cheap one but will work for just for couples months and you need to buy another
I previously had an HP laptop, it was constantly wanting to be updated from day to day. Ever since I brou this home and plugged it in, this is the best thing ever. Super quick and easier to use than the HP.
Great macbook but I am guessing the new one is better!
It is a great upgrade from what we had before. Could not get a printer to match the old Mac we had before. This should make a great difference in our lives. Thanks.
It was a great customer experience, sales associate felix helped me with everything I needed.
The 2015 MacBook Pro (MBP) is a fantastic device; other than the obvious beauty of Apple's portable computer designs, the MBP is fast, efficient, and sports a display that makes other devices look poor in comparison. To top it all off, the battery life is phenomenal, and I don't feel tethered to a wall outlet every time I take my computer somewhere. Though not quite as power efficient as a MacBook Air, the power and beauty of the MBP more than makes up for that single drawback and makes this one of the most well-rounded high end laptops in the consumer market.
Big improvement over my old one: fast, beautiful visual, it's thiner, lighter, and has some improved functions. A great laptop !
i PURCHASED THIS LAPTOP FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS . IT IS A VERY FAST MACHINE
I would say, it's not much different from the old version except faster. But the most impressive thing that make me fall in love with this laptop is the new Force Touch trackpad. After I bought it, I still don't believe in what they said online. The new technology is apple put a thing that called haptic feedback. It gives u an illusion that you feel the clicking but actually, the trackpad doesn't move at all. it's pretty awesome experience.
First time MAC book purchase great computer ,software and overall quality apple makes great products works seamlessly with iPhone 6 .
You can never go wrong with with a Recently Released New Apple MacBook Pro with Retina Display!
Runs photo shop and other programs necessary for other college classes
Unbelievable screen , new touchpad has amazing realistic feel. Super fast upgrade from my MacBook Air
Just got this new MacBook Pro retina, and the display is absolutely amazing! I am loving this thing.
"Have been using MacBook Pros since the 17"" models. Previously had the Mid 2014 15"" refresh and am glad I upgraded.

The new 2015 13"" is equivlent, even in the base model to the entry level 15"" 2014 model. Everything just seems as quick with the newer CPU, Intel VGA, SSD and logic board chipset. Force pad touchpad works similar to the older pad w/o the loud click sounds when pressed, however, still hinged to simulate a click feel. I've used it mainly for browsing on Chrome &amp; Firefox, notes, spreadsheets, documents, some terminal/console parsing and learning IDE development (compiles and runtime with Eclipse equivalent to my 15""), movie and photo editing. Definitely a noticeable upgrade from the previous model.

The Retina display is definitely a must with any laptop, increases the use of 1 screen w/o the need of an external monitor. Of course having a larger native display screen is better but it does come with a weight penalty. If only they would release a MacBook Air with a Retina screen...

The only deficiencies on the 13"" 2015 model come in the form of hardcore gaming or streaming video, the onboard Nvidia VGA with my 15"" 2014 model had less artifacts such as frame drops, judder and blocking or jaggies compared to the Intel VGA. This is expected with the entry level Intel VGAs."
Espectacular!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Had to exchange for the 2.7 processor. No big deal, great machine.
This is my third version of this beautiful machine, and it is slightly slimmer, slightly faster,but its like reviewing a Ferrari, there was nothing wrong with the last one! It was just time for my ex gf to inherit it!
I have been using a AMD FX-8350 8 cores @ 4ghz, 8gb ram, GTX-970 4GB Video card and SSD hard drive to edit videos, and decided to buy a Mac because my friends told me Mac work better on video editing and I need it something portable......Wow I was surprise. Using GoPro studio this laptop rendered a 4k video in 2min compared to almost 5min on my AMD 8 cores 4ghz PC..... The i5 combined with this OS works excellent. Love it
The Macbook Pro 13 (Early 2015 Model) is lightning fast. The new touchpad is extremely easy to use and has a very unique feel to it with the Taptic feedback settings. You can now push harder on the touchpad and it acts as a new click (3 finger gesture control was the same). You will get an extra 1 hour of battery life from this version and the 2014 model (I tested to confirm). The screen has the same brightness (around 300 nits). The SSD card read and write times have doubled from last year. The memory is faster at 1867 MHz and the Graphics is a new Intel Iris 6100 using 1.5MB of RAM. If you have a 2014 model this might not be the greatest update for you but if you have the 2013 or older this is a huge upgrade and easily worth the money. If you are on a budget but need a work horse and you like the Mac OS then you could also consider the 2014 model since it is now $150 cheaper. You can also do some gaming on this and if you have a Steam account you can also stream from another Mac or PC to this laptop with no problem. This will be the laptop I get my son when he leaves for college in the fall. I was going to get the Macbook Air for him but since the battery is now just as long on the Macbook Pro and the extra power, it's the right choice.
