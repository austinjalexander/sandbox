This is my first DSLR camera and I LOVE IT! The overall design is very ergonomically-engineered. All the controls and buttons are easy to operate. Very user-friendly especially for beginners. Pretty cool stuff although I'd really appreciate it if they integrated the Wi-fi in it or made the screen flippable like what they did on D5300. Nonetheless, awesome device! Good deal for a bundle kit! Definitely recommended! I'm going to try this out for a couple of weeks, maybe months, and if it works out, I'm going pro. :-D
Great camera! I love how I can use lenses from my old Nikon D60 with this D3300! Easy to use; fast shutter; quiet, lightweight; reasonable price for a quality camera. Would definitely recommend!
