UPON DOING SO HE WAS HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THE BRAKES BUT HE MANAGED TO PULL THE TRUCK INTO A PARKING LOT. UPON EXAMINING HIS TRUCK WE SEEN THAT THE DRIVE SHAFT WAS SPLIT IN HALF, HIS MUFFLER WAS BROKEN OFF AND THE DRIVE SHAFT WAS STUCK IN-BETWEEN MY BACK BRAKES. HE CALLED CHRYSLER AFTER LOOKING UP REPAIRS AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS A RECALL ON HIS TRUCK FOR THIS VERY PROBLEM WITH THE BOLT COMING OUT. HE SPOKE WITH A WOMAN NAMED HELEN (WOULD NOT GIVE HER LAST NAME NOR EXT NUMBER) AND SHE TOLD HIM TO HAVE HIS TRUCK TOWED TO THE DEALERSHIP WHICH HE DID. TODAY HE IS GETTING THE GO AROUND AND IS BEING TOLD THAT HE HAD TO PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT FALLS ON THE MANUFACTURER. THE GENERAL MANGER TOLD HIM THAT THE WOMAN HELEN DID NOT FILE IT AS A RECALL THAT IT WAS A WARRANTY ISSUE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY SHE DID THAT AND WHY THEY ARE ACTING LIKE THIS. HE DID NOT RECEIVE ANYTHING IN THE MAIL ABOUT A RECALL ON HIS TRUCK. WE LATER FOUND OUT THAT WHAT HE PAID FOR OUT OF POCKET FOR ELECTRICAL WAS ALSO A RECALL. NO ONE HAS DONE AN AUTHORIZATION TO FIX HIS TRUCK NOR HAVE ANSWERS. MY FAMILY COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED AND OTHERS COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED OF INJURED DUE THESE PARTS COMING OFF HIS TRUCK. I WOULD LIKE FOR MY HUSBAND TO GET HIS TRUCK FIXED AND BE COMPENSATED FOR WHAT HE HAS PAID FOR (TOWING, RENTAL, AND ELECTRICAL WORK). IF WE HAVE TO GO TO NEWS OUTLETS TO MAKE SURE THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN TO ANY OTHER FAMILY AND TO PREVENT SOMEONE FROM BEING KILLED AND INJURED WE WILL.

SOON AFTER, GMC STARTED DOING THE RECALLS ON THE AIRBAGS. MY ACADIA IS NOT ONE OF THE LISTED RECALLED VEHICLES. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS. IT IS NOW THE END OF JULY, AND THE CHECK AIRBAG LIGHT IS ON AGAIN. I HAVE BEEN BACK TO GLYNN SMITH AND IT IS THE SAME CODE THIS TIME. I HAVE ANOTHER FAULTY DRIVER SIDE AIRBAG AND AIRBAG SWITCH.

IT WAS LIKE TURNING A REALLY OLD MODEL CAR THAT HAD NO POWER STEERING. THIS PROBLEM CONTINUES TODAY. GMC TELLS ME THAT THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE POWER STEERING. THEY CANNOT FIND THE PROBLEM, YET I KNOW FOR SURE SOMETHING IS WRONG. THE 2008 GMC ACADIA IS NOT A SAFE CAR. I HAVE SMALL CHILDREN, AND I DO NOT FEEL SAFE DRIVING WITH THEM AND THE CHECK AIRBAG LIGHT STILL ON. MY FAMILY IS VERY UPSET WITH GMC AS A COMPANY!! SAFETY SHOULD BE THE MAIN CONCERN BEFORE SELLING ANY VEHICLE. I SEE THAT MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH THEIR ACADIA. I THINK THAT GMC SHOULD DO THE RIGHT THING, THE MOST ETHICAL THING, AND RECALL THE ENTIRE LINE OF THE 2008 GMC ACADIA.

THIS OCCURS SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK AND CREATES A PANIC RESPONSE ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE PULLING AWAY FROM A LIGHT OR MERGING INTO TRAFFIC.  CARS FROM BEHIND HAVE TO HIT THEIR BRAKES WHEN YOU PULL OUT INTO A LANE OF TRAFFIC AND THE CAR STALLS.     MY WIFE AND I HAVE DRIVEN SIX DIFFERENT VEHICLES OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS ALL WHICH HAD MANUAL TRANSMISSIONS. FOUR OF THESE VEHICLES WERE VW’S.  WE KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE WHEN YOU ACCIDENTLY “POP THE CLUTCH”.  THERE IS USUALLY A SHUTTER AND YOU FEEL THE VEHICLE COMES TO AN ABRUPT STOP.  IN THE CASE ON MY 2014 VW BEETLE, YOU SOMETIME NEVER FEEL ANYTHING THROUGH THE CLUTCH PEDAL AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU SEE THE ALTERNATOR LIGHT AND YOU REALIZE THE ENGINE IS “DEAD”.     I TOOK THE CAR INTO THE VW DEALER AND THE SHOP SUPERVISOR DROVE THE CAR WITH ME AS A PASSENGER. AS IT WOULD BE, THE CAR NEVER STALLED EVER AFTER MAKING MAY STOPS AND PULLING UP HILLS, ETC.  THE DEALERSHIP WAS VERY NICE AND DID TRY TO MAKE THE CAR BEHAVE AS I HAVE DESCRIBED ABOVE. UNFORTUNATELY IT DID NOT.

CAN ONLY BE OPENED WITH THE KEY FOB (NO KEY LOCK ON THIS MODEL), OR BY UNLOCKING THE BACK SEATS AND CRAWLING INTO THE TRUNK COMPARTMENT TO PULL THE MANUAL RELEASE.  WHILE THIS IS A PAIN IN THE NECK, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO POSE A HAZARD.    ON JULY 27 (108291 MILES) THE FRONT PASSENGER DOOR LOCK QUIT WORKING - TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY.  THERE ARE FOUR WAYS TO OPEN THIS DOOR, WITH THE KEY FOB, THE ELECTRIC LOCK/UNLOCK MECHANISM ON BOTH THE DRIVER'S SIDE AND THE PASSENGER'S SIDE, AND FINALLY THE MANUAL LOCK/UNLOCK MECHANISM.  ALL OF THESE QUIT WORKING AND THERE IS NO EXTERIOR MANUAL KEY LOCK TO ACCESS EITHER.    IN THE EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT OR AN EMERGENCY, THE PASSENGER HAS NO QUICK AND EASY WAY TO GET OUT OF THE CAR.  THEY MUST EXIT THE SAME WAY THE ENTERED THE VEHICLE, BY CRAWLING OVER THE DRIVER'S SIDE SEAT AND WHEEL, EMERGENCY BRAKE AND TRANSMISSION SHIFT MECHANISM.

RE THE TRANSMISSION, MY FIRST OCCURRENCE WAS WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO ENTER A VERY BUSY INTERSECTION AND MY CAR WOULD BARELY MOVE. MY MECHANIC EXPLAINED LATER THAT THE CAR WAS STUCK IN 3RD GEAR SO I COULD NOT GET MY NORMAL FORWARD MOVEMENT. HE TOLD ME IF IT HAPPENED AGAIN TO TURN MY ENGINE OFF, COUNT TO TEN AND TURN IT BACK ON. FORTUNATELY HE TOLD ME THIS BECAUSE THE NEXT TIMES IT HAPPENED I WAS ON LINCOLN BLVD. IN MARINA DEL REY, CA. AND MY CAR WOULD NOT ACCELERATE AT ALL. ONE TIME I WAS AT A RED LIGHT SO HAD TIME TO TURN IT OFF AND ON. THE NEXT TIME I HAD TO COAST INTO A VERY SMALL CENTER DIVIDER THAT WAS GROWING SMALLER AND WITH TRAFFIC FLYING BY ON MY SIDE AND ONCOMING I HAD  TO TURN OFF MY ENGINE, COUNT TO TEN AND TURN IT ON.

THEY REPLACED: INTERMEDIATE SHAFT, RACK MOUNTS, FRAMES, COLL, CLOCKSPRING, AND STEERING RACK. IT COSTS ME $2113.67 AND IT TOOK 10 DAYS TO BE FIXED.   NOTICE:  ON MY WAY TO WORK IN THE MORNING THE CAR WAS DRIVABLE BUT I NOTICED THAT THE STEERING WHEEL BECOME HEAVIER.""I WAS DRIVING TO WORK, ON A STRAIGHT STRETCH OF ROAD AT ABOUT 25 MILES AN HOUR, WHEN A ""SERVICE ADVANCTRAC"" WARNING LIGHT CAME ON, AS WELL AS A POWER STEERING FAULT. I LOST POWER STEERING AT THAT POINT. LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO PULL OVER INTO A PARKING LOT, AND THEN I DROVE HOME WITH MY HAZARD LIGHTS ON. THE CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY SO WE TOOK IT TO A LOCAL SHOP, WHO LOOKED AT THE CODES AND THE CAR AND DIAGNOSED IT AS A FAULTY RACK AND PINION. THEY REPLACED THAT (AT A COST OF $1500) AND THE POWER STEERING NOW WORKS AGAIN, BUT I AM NOT COMFORTABLE DRIVING IT ANY LONGER. WHAT IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN WHILE I AM TURNING OR MERGING ONTO A FREEWAY? SCARY, SCARY THOUGHT. THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY FORD AND A RECALL MADE.    ""FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, I HAVE NOTICED THAT MY DASHBOARD HAS GOTTEN VERY SHINY AND VERY, VERY STICKY, CAUSING AN UNSIGHTLY MESS AND, WORSE, CAUSING A DISTRACTING REFLECTION ONTO THE WINDSHIELD.  I DIDN'T KNOW THE REASON UNTIL RECENTLY WHEN I SAW A REPORT ON THE NEWS OF NUMEROUS OTHER PEOPLE HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THEIR LEXUS.  ""AFTER STOPPING AT STOP SIGN AND TURNING. THE AIRBAG INDICATOR LIGHT STARTED FLASHING. TOOK IT TO THE DEARLERSHIP IT WAS BOUGHT FROM. THEY ""REPAIRED"" THE PROBLEM. AFTER TRAVELING LESS THAN 2 MILES FROM DEALERSHIPS,THE LIGHT STARTED BACK FLASHING. I RETURNED TO DEALERSHIP. THEY WANTED TO KNOW IF I HAD WRECKED THE VEHICLE. I HAVE NOT. AFTER 2 HRS, THEY SAID I WOULD HAVE TO REPLACE THE SPIRAL CABLE AND IT WAS NOT COVERED BY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY.  IT WOULD BE CLOSE TO 600 DOLLARS. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT IF AN ACCIDENT WERE TO OCCUR, MY AIRBAGS WOULD NOT DEPLOY.  I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED. THAT IS LIKE TELLING SOMEONE THE SEATBELT IN THEIR CAR WILL NOT WORK. NOT EVERYONE HAS THAT KIND OF MONEY TO SPEND THESE DAYS."DRIVING AT A AVERAGE SPEED OF 60-70 WHEN PASSING ON THE HWY MY CLUTCH PEDAL WAS STUCK TO THE FLOOR AND I HAD TO PULL IT OUT WITH MY FOOT TO CHANGE GEARS.

NOW I HAVE TO WAIT LONGER FOR A NEW ONE TO REPLACE THE ONE THAT WAS PUT IN.

THIS IS A FOLLOW-UP REQUEST FOR INVESTIGATION.  SUMMARY: DRIVER'S SIDE FRONT SUSPENSION SPRING CATASTROPHICALLY FAILED WHEN BACKING OUT OF DRIVEWAY.  THIS HAD THE SAME CONDITIONS AS DESCRIBED IN RECALL 04S17 ON 1999 TO 2001 TAURUS.  AFTER REPAIR AT MY OWN COST, I SOLD THE CAR.    I WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO THE PREVIOUS COMPLAINT THAT THE VEHICLE WAS SOMEWHAT UNIQUE IN THAT IT WAS A FORMER GSA VEHICLE.  I HAD BROUGHT IT AT A GSA AUCTION.  THIS IS UNIQUE SINCE THE GSA VEHICLES ARE BROUGHT UNDER A LARGE CONTRACT AND MAY BE MANUFACTURED SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY FROM THE OTHER VEHICLES THUS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE INVESTIGATIONS. ""THIS MORNING THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WAS THAT THE CRUISE CONTROL WOULD NOT WORK.  THIS AFTERNOON, I WENT TO A LOCAL HARDWARE STORE, PURCHASED SOME ITEMS THEN WENT TO MY VAN. WHEN OPENING THE DRIVER DOOR, THE DRIVER SIDE AIR BAG DEPLOYED FROM THE STEERING WHEEL.  THERE IS NO SIGN OF ANY DAMAGE TO  THE OUTSIDE OF THE CAR.  I DID NOTICE THAT WHEN I STARTED THE VAN THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS BEGAN BUT I COULD NOT STOP THEM.    WHEN THE WRECKER CAME AND THE CAR WAS STARTED, THE WIPERS DID NOT COME ON BY THEM SELVES AGAIN  GLAD THAT THIS DID NOT HAPPEN WHEN THE CAR WAS MOVING.. ""MY CAR HAS KEYLESS ENTRY TO TURN ON AND OFF IGNITION.  WHEN I PARKED THE CAR IN THE GARAGE, I TURNED OFF THE IGNITION BUT FAILED TO PUT THE CAR IN PARK AND IT WAS LEFT IN DRIVE.  I WALKED AWAY FROM THE CAR AND IT BEGAN TO ROLL BACKWARDS WHERE IT HIT MY BASKETBALL POLE AND CAUSED QUITE A BIT OF DAMAGE TO THE CAR.  I THINK THERE IS A DESIGN FLAW WITH THE KEYLESS ENTRY ON THIS VEHICLE.  WITH KEYED ENTRY VEHICLES YOU CAN NOT TURN OFF THE ENGINE WHILE IT IS IN DRIVE AND MUST BE PLACED IN PARK TO TURN OFF THE VEHICLE.  OTHER KEYLESS VEHICLES I HAVE DRIVEN SUCH AS THE AUDI A8 HAVE A FEATURE IF YOU TURN THE VEHICLE OFF WHILE IN DRIVE IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY PUT THE CAR IN PARK.  THE PORSCHE PANAMERA, ON THE OTHER HAND, TAKES THE CAR OUT OF DRIVE AND PUTS IT INTO NEUTRAL SO THAT IT CAN ROLL FORWARD OR BACKWARD WHICH I BELIEVE IS A VERY DANGEROUS CONDITION.  IN MY CASE, IT TOOK THE CAR OUT OF DRIVE AND MOVED TO NEUTRAL TO ALLOW IT TO ROLL BACKWARDS.  IF THERE WAS A CHILD BEHIND  MY CAR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN INJURED OR KILLED.  I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE SOME KIND OF DESIGN FEATURE OF KEYLESS VEHICLES THAT WOULD PUT THE CAR IN TO PARK WHEN THE ENGINE IS TURNED OFF OR AT LEAST NOT ALLOW THE DRIVER TO ACCIDENTALLY TURN OFF THE VEHICLE WILL IN STILL IN THE DRIVE POSITION.  I AM NOT SURE HOW OTHER MANUFACTURERS DEAL WITH KEYLESS ENTRY BUT I FEEL THE DESIGN OF THE PORSCHE WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO A SERIOUS INJURY."WAS DRIVING AT 45MPH AND ALL OF SUDDEN COULD TELL SOMETHING WAS DIFFERENT WITH THE STEERING.

COULD HAVE BEEN REALLY BAD IF I HAD BEEN DRIVING FASTER.DASHBOARD IS COMING APART AND STEERING WHEEL  AS WELL TOOK IT TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAID MY CAR WAS OUT OF WARRANTY. "THE DASHBOARD IS IN VERY POOR CONDITION WITH A STICKY AND MELTING APPEARANCE.  I COMPLAINED TO LEXUS OF TOYOTA AND WAS TOLD THAT THE WARRANTY WOULD NOT COVER TO REPLACE OR FIX THE  PROBLEM.  CONSIDERING THAT I DID NOT HAVE MONEY TO REPLACE THIS WITH MY OWN FUNDS, I DID NOT PURSUE IT.

TOOK CAR TO DEALERSHIP, DIAGNOSTICS /TROUBLESHOOTING FAILED TO IDENTIFY PROBLEM. PROBLEM WAS CONSISTENTLY CLEARED BY TURNING OFF ENGINE AND RESTARTING.    ON 28 JULY, POWER STEERING WAS LOST COMPLETELY DURING ENGINE START AND SUCCESSIVE RESTARTS FAILED TO CLEAR THE ""POWER STEERING ASSIST FAILURE"" FAULT.  ALSO RECEIVED ""SERVICE ADVANCE TRAC"" WARNING.  CAR WAS TOWED TO DEALERSHIP.  DIAGNOSTICS DETERMINED THE ELECTRONIC STEERING RACK NEEDED TO BE REPLACED.  REPAIR ESTIMATE IS $2000!  HAD CAR FOR LESS THAN THREE YEARS AND CAR ONLY HAD 78,000 ON IT.  (FORD CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED MODEL.) VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CAR.  WORST FORD CAR I'VE OWNED.  CURSORY WEB SEARCHES ON THIS POWER STEERING PROBLEM  REVEALS A MYRIAD OF OCCURRENCES FOR THE 2010 FUSION.    THIS SUDDEN LOSS OF POWER STEERING REPRESENTS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THIS RESULTS IN FATALITIES.  NHTSA WEBSITE CURRENTLY INDICATES 120 COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE POWER STEERING FAILURE ON THE 2010 FORD FUSION (MORE THAN 10% OF ALL THE COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE CAR).  WHY HASN'T THERE BEEN A RECALL OR TSB ISSUED FOR THIS PROBLEM?

MALFUNCTION OF INTEGRAL LOCK SENSOR IN STEERING COLUMN NECESSITATES REPLACEMENT OF ENTIRE STEERING COLUMN,  IT IS A SAFETY PROBLEM AND SHOULD BE COVERED BY A BMW CUSTOMER SATISFACTION CAMPAIGN.

I CONTACTED BMW CUSTOMER SERVICE, EXPLAINED MY PROBLEM AND WAS TOLD THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING TO COVER THIS VERY COMMON QUALITY PROBLEM AND WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER A MANUFACTURERS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION CAMPAIGN.  ON THE NHTSA WEBSITE, THERE ARE MANY CASES REPORTED THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM! AND THAT'S WHY! I AM REPORTING THIS INCIDENT TO NHTSA IN HOPES THAT BMW WILL DO SOMETHING FOR OTHER OWNERS AS THE REPAIR BILL WAS $1000 AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED BY BMW. ALL I THINK ABOUT IS!

I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT...IT SEEMED TO SHOW UP ALL AT ONCE, AND I HAD NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN TO A VEHICLE BEFORE. MY RX HAS LOW MILES AND HAS NEVER BEEN IN ANY KIND OF ACCIDENT. IN 45 YEARS WE HAVE OWNED MANY VEHICLES, HAVE DRIVEN MANY OF THEM TO OVER 200,000, AND NONE OF THEM HAVE EVER HAD A CRACK IN THE DASH, MUCH LESS CRACKING ACROSS THE ENTIRE DASH!  IN FACT MY SISTER IN CA HAS THE EXACT SAME VEHICLE, BUT HERS HAS 225,000 MILES, AND HER DASH IS PERFECT!  IMMEDIATELY, I SUSPECTED A QUALITY ISSUE, AND ASSUMED THAT SURELY LEXUS WOULD STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT. BOY WAS I WRONG!  I TOOK IT INTO MY DEALERSHIP FOR AN INSPECTION, WAITED 6 WEEKS FOR A REPLY, AND WHEN NO RESPONSE WAS GIVEN, I CALLED BACK.  I WAS TOLD THE VEHICLE WAS OUT OF WARRANTY (WE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT A WEAR-AND-TEAR ISSUE HERE ...THIS IS A QUALITY ISSUE!).  BECAUSE MY HUSBAND DOES THE REGULARLY SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE, I WAS TOLD THAT THE DECISION NOT TO OFFER ASSISTANCE WAS BECAUSE WE HAD NOT SPENT ENOUGH MONEY WITH THEM!  HOWEVER, THAT THEY SURELY HOPED I COULD GET LEXUS TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, BECAUSE THEN THEY WOULD MAKE MONEY ON THE REPAIR!  CAN YOU BELIEVE IT!  LIKE OTHER OWNERS, I AM CONCERNED THIS WILL AFFECT THE INTEGRITY OF THE AIRBAGS.  THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER SIMILAR COMPLAINTS ABOUT CRACKING AND MELTING DASHBOARDS, AND IN SOUTH FLORIDA, THEY ARE TRYING TO GET A CLASS-ACTION SUIT ON THE PROBLEMS.  COME ON LEXUS, I EXPECTED MORE FROM YOU!  DON'T ADVERTISE YOUR PRODUCT AS A QUALITY PRODUCT, WHEN SHODDY PARTS ARE USED IN ITS PRODUCTION.  WE BOUGHT THE RX BECAUSE WE WANTED A VEHICLE THAT WOULD LAST A LONG TIME; WE'VE HAD 2 TOYOTA AVALONS WE HAVE PUT OVER 200,000 MILES ON. STEP UP, AND STAND BEHIND YOUR PRODUCT!

I HAVE ALSO HAD TO HAVE A CHIP REPLACED AS WELL.  THE FIST OCCURRENCE IS WHEN A LARGE CRACK APPEARED IN MY WINDSHIELD AFTER BEING PARKED IN MY PARENTS DRIVEWAY.  THE CRACK STARTED FROM THE LEFT SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD AND ACROSS MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 12 INCHES IN LENGTH.  I IMMEDIATELY CALLED THE DEALERSHIP WHERE I PURCHASED THE CAR AND SCHEDULED AN APPOINTMENT.  THE SERVICE MANAGER PERFORMED THE ""PEN TEST"" AND INFORMED ME THAT THE DAMAGE WAS DUE TO A CHIP FROM DEBRIS.  I STATED THE CAR WAS PARKED IN A DRIVEWAY AND THERE TO THE NAKED EYE THERE WAS NO CHIP MARK WHATSOEVER. NEEDLESS TO SAY THEY DID NOT COVER IT AND I PROCEEDED WITH A CLAIM TO MY INSURANCE.

LOOK DOWN TO SEE MY DRIVE LIGHT FLASHING & AM STEADILY DECREASING IN SPEED WITH NO WAY TO ACCELERATE, LIKE IN NEUTRAL. I LUCKILY WAS ABLE TO GET OUT OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC, PUT THE CAR IN PARK WHICH BEGAN TO FLASH. ACCELERATED A COUPLE TIMES TO BE SURE IT RESPONDED BEFORE DRIVING BUT THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON. DRIVING AGAIN, ABOUT TO MAKE A LEFT TURN, NOT A MILE DOWN THE ROAD, SAME THING HAPPENED. THIS TIME  PUT IT IN PARK, ACCELERATED & NOTHING. SHUT OFF MY CAR TO RESET IT & MY CAR WOULD NOT TURN ON. AFTER WAITING FOR THE TOW TRUCK, THE CAR WOULD JUST NOT TURN ON, EVERYTHING RELATED TO THE BATTERY WOULD TURN ON BUT THE CAR DIDN'T. IN THE SHOP THIS 1ST TIME A TOTAL OF 3 DAYS, STILL UNSURE ABOUT IT BEING FIXED (BECAUSE THEY JUST FIXED THE ""ELECTRICAL"" PART, NOT THE ISSUE) LO & BEHOLD WHEN I TURNED INTO MY NEIGHBORHOOD SAME THING HAPPENED (DRIVE LIGHT FLASHED & ACCELERATOR DIDN'T RESPOND). I GET HOME TO PARK & TURN ON MY CAR, AFTER ATTEMPTING TO TURN IT BACK ON, NOTHING. ANOTHER TOW TRUCK CAME THE NEXT MORNING TO GET IT, THIS TIME MY CAR WAS THERE 7 DAYS. AFTER 2 DAYS OF DRIVING THE SAME THING HAPPENED I WAS ON A HILL ALMOST BEGAN ROLLING BACKWARDS INTO ANOTHER CAR UNTIL I PUT IT INTO P & PULLED THE E BREAK.

I CONTACTED THE DEALER THAT SCHEDULED ME AN APPOINTMENT TO REPLACE A BRAKE BOOSTER RECALL ON 7/18/2014 AND WOULD ADDRESS OTHER ISSUES THAT I MAY HAVE. DURING MY APPOINTMENT IN THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT THE DEALERSHIP, IT WAS MENTIONED TO ME THAT THE REASON FOR THE ISSUES IN MY STEERING WHEEL WAS THERE RESULT OF MY FRONT STRUTS BEING WORN DOWN AND NEEDS TO BE REPLACED. I WAS TOLD THAT THE STRUTS WHERE ON BACK ORDER AND I WOULD BE NOTIFIED ONCE THEY COME IN. I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT FOR THEIR REPLACEMENT ON 8/1/2014 AT 9:45AM. AFTER 7/18/2014 MADE ME QUESTION IF MY CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED JEEP HAD UNDERWENT THE 125-POINT INSPECTION THAT IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED TO MAKE IT A CERTIFIED PRE-OWNED. I HAD THEN WENT ON THE JEEP WEBSITE TO FIND OUT WANT THE 125-POINT INSPECTION ENTAILED. UNDER #90 OF THE 125-POINT INSPECTION, SPEAKS OF SHOCKS AND STRUTS. MY QUESTION NOW WAS IF MY CERTIFIED JEEP UNDER WENT THE 125-POINT INSPECTION, THEN THE STRUTS SHOULD HAD BEEN ADDRESSED PRIOR TO SALE. I AM NOW BEGINNING TO EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL ISSUES WITH THE VEHICLE. I MADE NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS TO NOTIFY THE DEALERSHIP TO FIND OUT IF THE 125-POINT INSPECTION HAD BEEN COMPLETED. I WOULD NOT GET ANY COOPERATION, JUST PASSIVENESS. I HAD THAN CALLED THE JEEP CHRYLSER INFORMATION CENTER FOR SOME TYPE OF RESOLVE IN FINDING OUT IF THE 125-POINT INSPECTION WAS COMPLETED, TO NO SUCCESS. I AM VERY MUCH CONCERN OF MY SAFETY,AND I NEED TO KNOW IF THIS INSPECTION WAS CONDUCTED PRIOR TO IT BEING SOLD TO ME. IF THE DEALERSHIP DID NOT CONDUCT THE 125-POINT INSPECTION, I WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE OF THIS ACTION. PLEASE HELP ME IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE WITH THIS MATTER. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE.""I HAD CLOSED ONE OF MY DOORS ON THE DRIVER SIDE WITH PRETTY STRONG FORCE (SLAM), AND THE SIDE CURTAIN AIRBAGS DEPLOYED ON BOTH THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDES.

THE SHOCK ABSORBER THAT IS BOLTED TO THE GEAR BOX CONTROL ROD FROM THE RIGHT TIE ROD TO THE LEFT WAS BUSTED CAUSING OIL TO LEAK OUT.

I WAS JUST AT THE DODGE DEALERSHIP TODAY IN REGARDS THIS RECALL ON A RECALL AND THE ASSOCIATES AT THE DODGE DEALERSHIP LOCATED IN BEEVILLE TEXAS ADVICED ME TO BRING MY VEHICLE BACK IN TWO TO THREE MONTHS BECAUSE THERE WERE OTHERS AHEAD. "I AM A AUTO MECHANIC AND UNFORTUNATELY OWN A 1999 DODGE AVENGER 2.5L V6 AUTO. THE ENGINE IS JUNK. IT HAS HAD AN INTERMITTENT MISFIRE SINCE BEFORE I BOUGHT IT. CHRYSLER KNOWS THEY PUT A FAULTY CAMSHAFT SENSOR INSIDE THE DISTRIBUTOR SO WHEN IT DOES FAIL WHICH IT DOES IN EVERY 6 CYCLE AVENGER, THE STEALERSHIP TRIES TO TELL CUSTOMERS THAT THE SENSOR CANNOT BE REPLACED AND YOU HAVE TO GET A NEW DISTRIBUTOR ASSEMBLY WHICH THEY CHARGE $ 1500 FOR PARTS AND LABOR. YOU CAN'T BUY ONE ANYWHERE ELSE BECAUSE OF THE FAULTY CAM SENSOR PROBLEM AND THEY DO THIS INTENTIONALLY TO GET YOU TO SPEND MONEY ON CHRYSLER PARTS. THEY PUT THE CAM SENSOR IN THE DISTRIBUTOR BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT MAGNETIC INTERFERENCE FROM THE IGNITION COIL WOULD CAUSE THE SENSOR TO FAIL. WHEN THIS HAPPENS THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT FLASHES MORE AND MORE THE WORSE THE SENSOR GETS. THAT IS JUST THE START OF THE ENGINE PROBLEMS. ONCE THE CAM SENSOR FAILS THE TIMING GETS OFFSET AND OVER TIME CAUSES THE VALVES TO GET BENT BY THE PISTONS, AFTER THAT IT'S BYE BYE HEADS AND NO CAR UNLESS YOU BUY A BETTER CAR.

I'VE HAD NUMEROUS  INCIDENTS OF FUMES AFTER PARKING, DRIPPING FUEL, AND FUEL BOILING WITH  THE GAS CAP HEATED TO THE POINT THAT I COULD ONLY OPEN IT WHILE  WEARING GLOVES. DURING ONE OF MY FIRST TIMES REFUELING WHILE  LOOSENING THE GAS CAP MY HANDS WERE WASHED WITH FUEL THAT WAS  EXPELLED UNDER PRESSURE, SOAKING MY GLOVES. AFTERWARD I WAS CAREFUL  TO OPEN THE CAP SLOWLY (LIKE A COKE CAN UNDER PRESSURE) TO RELIEVE THE  BUILT UP PRESSURE IN THE GAS TANK. HEAT ON MY FOOT WAS SO BAD THAT  I’VE GONE THROUGH MANY PAIRS OF BOOTS AND WORE FIRE/HEAT RESISTANT  SOCKS TO MITIGATE DISCOMFORT. I HAD THE ECM SOFTWARE  UPDATE/FUSE BOX SEALING WARRANTY CAMPAIGN [2013-9] DONE ON MY BIKE AT  THE MALCOLM SMITH MOTORSPORTS DEALERSHIP. I CONTINUED TO HAVE HEAT  ISSUES. AFTER IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THERE WASN'T A SOLUTION TO MY  HEAT PROBLEM, I HAD THE EXHAUST WRAPPED AND INSULATION INSTALLED. THIS HAD  LITTLE TO NO EFFECT ON REDUCING HEAT.   ON SATURDAY (JULY 26, 2014) I LEFT MY HOME AT 5:50 PM TO RIDE.  THE TEMPERATURE WAS ABOUT 95 DEGREES. ONCE AGAIN, I NOTICED HEAT WHILE  RIDING. AT ABOUT 6:20 PM, TRAVELING AT A CRUISE-CONTROLLED 60 MPH ON  AMBOY ROAD IN THE MOJAVE DESERT, I SMELLED HOT OR BURNING PLASTIC AND  THEN I OBSERVED IN MY REAR VIEW MIRROR SMOKE COMING FROM THE REAR OF  MY SPYDER. AS I BEGAN TO SLOW, I ALSO NOTICED SMOKE COMING FROM THE  AREA JUST AHEAD OF THE SEAT. THINKING IT WAS EITHER AN ELECTRICAL  PROBLEM OR MELTING BODYWORK, I PULLED TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, STOPPED  AND HIT THE KILL ENGINE SWITCH. AFTER GETTING OFF THE BIKE, I OPENED  THE SEAT. INSTANTLY THERE WAS A “WHOOSHING” SOUND AND THE BIKE WAS  ENGULFED IN FLAMES. I RAN ACROSS THE ROAD, CALLED 911, AND WHILE WAITING FOR THE FIRE CREW I TOOK PICTURES AND VIDEO OF MY BURNING SPYDER.

THANKFULLY, THERE WEREN'T LOTS OF CAR ON THE ROAD. I DROVE ON THE SIDE GRASS FOR FEW HUNDRED YARDS AND FINALLY MANAGED TO STOPPED THE VEHICLE. THE NEXT DAY, I TOOK IT TO THE NEAR BY SHOP AND THEY SUGGESTED THAT I SHOULD REPLACE THE BREAK SINCE THE CAR WASN'T ABLE TO STOP. AFTER SPENDING $650 TO REPLACE THE BREAKS AND BREAK PADS, I LEFT THE SHOP. AFTER 6 MONTHS THE CHECK VSC SYSTEM LIGHT CAME ON. I TOOK IT TO TOYOTA DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME THAT I'VE TO REPLACE ABS BREAK ACTUATOR AND QUOTED ME AROUND $3700. I DIDN'T HAVE THAT MUCH MONEY TO SPEND, SO I STARTED SEARCHING FOR ALTERNATIVE ON THE INTERNET. THAT IS WHEN, I RAN IN TO THIS SITE WHERE PEOPLE ARE REPORTING THE ISSUES THAT THEIR 2007-2008 TOYOTA CAMRY HYBRID ARE HAVING. I WOULD LIKE TOYOTA TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE AND FIX MY CAR.

THANK YOU!""DRIVING DOWN A NEIGHBORHOOD ROAD WITH MY WIFE AS A PASSENGER ON JULY 12 AND GOING AT ABOUT 25 MILES AN HOUR APPROACHING THE TRAFFIC LIGHT AT A BUSY INTERSECTION, I NOTICED THAT MY TWO-WEEKS OLD BRAND NEW BMW WAS NOT SLOWING DOWN ALTHOUGH I MADE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO STOP IT BY USING THE FOOT PEDAL TO BRAKE. THE CLOSER I GOT TO THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME, I CONTINUED TO ATTEMPT TO STOP THE CAR BUT IT FAILED AND I ENDED UP HITTING THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME.  FORTUNATELY, THE PERSON IN THE CAR THAT I HIT WAS NOT INJURED AND NEITHER WERE WE.  I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE BMW DEALERSHIP AND THEY ENDED UP PICKING UP THE CAR ON JULY 14. TWO DAYS LATER THEY CALLED ME BACK TO LET ME KNOW THAT THEY HAD THOROUGHLY CHECKED THE CAR AND FOUND NOTHING WRONG WITH IT.  I INSISTED THAT THEY NEEDED TO CONTINUE EVALUATING THE CAR AND ADVISED THEM THAT I WOULD PREFER FOR THEM TO PERFORM ADDITIONAL DIAGNOSTIC TESTING, SINCE WE HAVE OWNED THE CAR FOR 2 WEEKS AND HAD NO PRIOR WARNING OF ANY MALFUNCTION. THEY CONTINUED EVALUATING THE CAR AND FOUND NOTHING WRONG SO THEY CONTACTED BMW NA. ON JULY 22, I WAS CONTACTED BY BMW NA TO GET A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE INCIDENT AND TO LET ME KNOW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO SEND A SPECIALIST TO LOOK AT THE CAR AND CONDUCT SOME TESTING. ON JULY 31ST I WAS CONTACTED BY BMW NA TO LET ME KNOW THAT THE REPORT HAD BEEN SUBMITTED BY THE SPECIALIST AND THAT THE CAR IS IN PERFECT CONDITION AND THE BRAKES ARE WORKING AS THEY SHOULD.  I REQUESTED A WRITTEN STATEMENT FROM BMW CERTIFYING THAT THE CAR IS IN OPTIMAL CONDITION, SAFE TO DRIVE, AND HAS NO DEFECTS.  I ALSO REQUESTED A COPY OF THE REPORT PRODUCED BY THE SPECIALIST BUT BMW NA INFORMED ME THERE WAS NO REPORT AVAILABLE.  THEY DID AGREE TO SEND THE WRITTEN STATEMENT BY REGULAR MAIL WHICH WILL TAKE 5-7 DAYS.  THIS SEEMS TO BE A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN WHICH PUTS DRIVERS AT A HIGH RISK OF GETTING HURT OR HURTING SOMEONE ELSE, SCARY!  ""THE FIRST TIME IN SEPTEMBER 2013 THE VEHICLE WAS RUNNING FINE.

BRAKING WAS NEARLY NONEXISTENT AND IMMEDIATELY A RED WARNING LIGHT APPEARED ACCOMPANIED BY A BRAKE FAILURE LIGHT. THE FOOT BRAKE DID NOT FUNCTION AS WELL. AT THIS POINT THE LIGHT WAS TURNING RED AND I HAD NO CHANCE OF DOWNSHIFTING TO USE ENGINE BRAKING, SO MY ONLY HOPE TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT WAS TO DOWNSHIFT AND PROCEED THROUGH THE INTERSECTION. I HAD LOST ALL BRAKING ABILITY ON A MOTORCYCLE WHILE TRAVELING OVER 40MPH IN A HEAVY TRAFFIC AREA. ONLY BY PURE LUCK WAS THERE NO ACCIDENT.    AFTER TRAILERING THE MOTORCYCLE HOME, I DID SOME RESEARCH AND DISCOVERED THAT THIS IS A VERY COMMON PROBLEM AMONG 2005-2007 BMW MOTORCYCLES THAT USE THE INTEGRAL ABS PRESSURE MODULATOR PART# 34517698296. IT IS SO COMMON THAT THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT ADVERTISE REBUILDING THAT PART, AND SCRAP YARDS ACKNOWLEDGE THE HIGH DEMAND FOR THIS PART AND ADVERTISE IT ON THEIR WEBSITES. SEARCHING ""K1200 BRAKE FAILURE"" YIELDS AN ASTOUNDING NUMBER OF FORUM POSTS WITH OWNERS EXPERIENCE ERRATIC BRAKING PROBLEMS. UNFORTUNATELY, BMW HAS NOT RECALLED OR REDESIGNED THIS PART, SO I HAVE TO REPLACE IT WITH THE SAME DEFECTIVE PART THAT POTENTIAL MIGHT FAIL AGAIN AND CAUSE A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.     THE SEVERE IMPLICATIONS OF BRAKE FAILURES ON ANY VEHICLE CANNOT BE UNDERMINED. THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE POSSIBLY HAS, AND LIKELY WILL CAUSE SEVERE AND/OR FATAL ACCIDENTS TO NOT ONLY THE MOTORCYCLE RIDER, BUT OTHERS. I HAVE ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT BMW REGARDING THIS MATTER, AND THEY HAVE YET TO COMMENT ON IT. I HAVE AN OPEN CORRESPONDENCE WITH THEM FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW, AND THEY HAVE NOT CONTACTED ME CONCERNING THIS ISSUE.

WE HEARD A POP, PULLED OVER AND SAW THAT THE FRONT SUN ROOF BLEW OUTWARD, LOOKED LIKE A VOLCANO WITH ABOUT 4-6 INCH HOLE IN THE CENTER. THE GLASS DIDN’T APPEAR TO BE SAFETY GLASS. PIECES WERE 1-2 INCHES LONG X ¼ WIDE AND EXTREMELY JAGGED & VERY SHARP. UNFORTUNATELY WE DIDN’T TAKE A PICTURE. DUCT TAPE THE SUNROOF & PROCEED DOWN THE ROAD.     CALLED TOYOTA DEALERSHIP WHERE WE PURCHASED & ASKED SERVICE MANAGER HIS OPINION. WE WILL LOOK AT THE SUNROOF WHEN YOU RETURN. DISTRICT MANAGER WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT YOUR CAR.    DENVER TOYOTA DEALERSHIP REFUSED TO LOOK AT THE WARRANTED CAR SAYING “WE DON’T REPLACE OR REPAIR GLASS” & GAVE ME THE NAME & PHONE NUMBER OF DENVER AUTO GLASS CO.    CUT OUR TRIP SHORT AND RETURNED HOME. BEFORE GOING TO TOYOTA DEALERSHIP, WE TOOK CAR TO LOCAL AUTO REPAIR SHOP TO GET OPINION. SUNROOF IS TEMPERED GLASS.

MY INSURANCE COMPANY SAYS THEY ARE AWARE OF “TOYOTA EXPLODING SUNROOFS”. AND IN THE FUTURE THEY MAY TRY TO RECOVER ALL OF OUR MONIES.

I BELIEVE THAT THE FLOOR MAT CAUSED MY CAR TO HAVE LIMITED BRAKING ABILITY IN ADDITION TO POSSIBLE INCREASED ACCELERATION. THE NHTSA'S FINDINGS SEEM TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THIS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPLAINT WITH NHTSA ID NUMBER: 10384563 STATES THAT ""I PUSHED ON THE BRAKE... BUT THE CAR CONTINUED ACCELERATING"" AND THEN ""TOYOTA INSPECTED THE VEHICLE... AND SAID THEY ADJUSTED THE MAT"" IS ONE OF MANY THAT HAVE FINDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THE MALFUNCTION THAT CAUSED MY WRECK.""WE HAD THIS SAME RECURRING PROBLEM WITH THIS TAHOE FOR THE LAST 10K MILES.

HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ARE FLOODING THE INTERNET WITH THIS PROBLEM AND FORD IS TURNING A BLIND EYE TO IT! AND, THERE IS NO RECALL!! WE JUST FOUND OUT WE HAD THIS PROBLEM TODAY AFTER TAKING OUR CAR FOR ITS FIRST EVER INSPECTION IN THE DELAWARE LANES (WHICH IT FAILED DUE TO THE MALFUNCTION). THIS IS A HUGE SAFETY HAZARD. OWNERS OF THESE CARS ARE BASICALLY RIDING AROUND WITH NO INDICATION OF BRAKING WHEN THEIR LIGHTS ARE ON AND NO KNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM.

THIS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE ISSUE, WHICH THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN REPORTED WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE HALL EFFECT DEVICES IN THE KEY HEAD.  I AM AN EX GM ELECTRICAL ENGINEER - I UNDERSTAND NEUTRAL SAFETY.  THIS IS NOT A CLUTCH/TRANSMISSION NEUTRAL SAFETY ISSUE, THIS IS A KEY SWITCH FAILURE TO ENGAGE CRANK ISSUE.

ALMOST CAUSED MY FAMILY TO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT AND COULD HAVE RUPTURED THE TIRE CAUSING FURTHER DAMAGE, WHICH WAS THE CASE FOR MANY OTHER PEOPLE.  UPON RESEARCHING THE PROBLEM I HAVE DISCOVERED A HIGH VOLUME OF SIMILAR COMPLAINTS WITH THE SAME EXACT VEHICLE IN THE NORTHERN PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES.  I ASSUME THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE SALT THEY USE ON THE ROADS IN THE WINTER CAUSING RAPID EROSION.  MY MECHANIC SAYS THIS SHOULDN'T HAPPEN THIS EARLY IN A CAR'S LIFE.  OTHER CAR COMPANIES, SUCH AS FORD, HAVE HAD SIMILAR ISSUES AND DID ISSUE A RECALL.  IT IS CLEARLY A SAFETY ISSUE WHICH COULD CAUSE A FATAL ACCIDENT IF NOT ADDRESSED.

I CONTACTED DISCOUNT TIRE AND WAS TOLD TO BRING IN THE WHEEL, TIRE, AND PICTURES AND THEY WOULD FORWARD MY INFORMATION TO NITTO SO THAT THEY CAN START A CLAIM. NITTO DID NOT ANSWER THEREFORE I WAS GIVEN THE PHONE NUMBER AND I WILL TRY TO CONTACT THEM TOMORROW. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT MY CONSUMER RIGHTS ARE AS FAR AS GETTING THE COST OF MY VEHICLE, THE OTHER VEHICLE, MEDICAL BILLS, TOWING COSTS, AND TIME LOSS AND SUFFERING PAID. THIS IS SIMPLY UNFAIR AND I AM ANGRY THAT A DEFECT DUE TO THEIR TIRE HAS NOW COST ME A LOSS OF MY CAR AND NEITHER MY INSURANCE OR I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY."PEBBLE DAMAGE TO AIR CONDITIONER CONDENSER CAUSING  LOSE OF REFRIGERANT.
