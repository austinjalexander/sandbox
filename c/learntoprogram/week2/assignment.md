##Assignment 2!

1) what do you think ++ does when you put it next to i?

2) if i want the loop to run 5 times, why do i set the condition to i < 5?

3) how does line 17 differ from last week's version of it?

4) look at line 24; why can't we use = to compare stuff?

5) on line 48: why do we need to use \" inside the string?

6) rewrite the for-loop so that the user can set the number of times the loop runs

7) remember the square image below? modify the program you made last week (using loops of course!) so that you have to use as few lines of code as possible.

```
# # # # # # # # # #
#                 #
#                 #
#      *****      #
#      *****      #
#      *****      #
#                 #
#                 #
# # # # # # # # # #
```

###Prepare for next week

be thinking about how we could make these programs be more dynamic; for example, instead of only giving a user an option to quit the while-loop based on her input, what if we had a menu with five options and wanted to do something different for each?
