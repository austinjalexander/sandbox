##Assignment 1!

1) on line 54, what do you think %s does? 

2) what do you think the difference is between %s and %d?

3) instead of entering an integer, try entering a decimal (e.g., 34.5); what happens? why do you think it does that?

4) remember the square image below from last week's assignment? modify the program you made so that a user could replace # and * with different characters

```
# # # # # # # # # #
#                 #
#                 #
#      *****      #
#      *****      #
#      *****      #
#                 #
#                 #
# # # # # # # # # #
```

 5) **classic assignment:** create a celsius to fahrenheit converter. use the formula: fahrenheit = ((celsius * 9) / 5) + 32; let a user input a temperature, convert it, then display the result. [note: those parentheses are placed in the formula because of a mathematical/programming notion called "precedence", or "order of operations"; if you're unfamiliar with that idea, *google* or ask!]


###Prepare for next week

be thinking about how we could make these programs easier to write; for example, instead of typing out 50 print statements, how could we just type one, but make it work 50 times?
