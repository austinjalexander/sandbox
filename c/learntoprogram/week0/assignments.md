##Assignment 0!

**for the following, submit at least #7 to me somehow (e.g., via email);** other than that, if you get stuck on any of these, just let me know):

1. in main.c, try deleting // on line 4 to see what the compiler says

2. what do you think \n does?

3. change "hello, world\n" to "\thello\t\tworld\n"; what do you think \t does?

4. try printing your name instead of "hello, world"

5. create a program that outputs your name more than once. then come up with a different way to do the same thing (don't forget to make use of \n and \t).

6. what does it seem like ";" does?

7. create a program that outputs the following:

```
# # # # # # # # # #
#                 #
#                 #
#      *****      #
#      *****      #
#      *****      #
#                 #
#                 #
# # # # # # # # # #
```

###Prepare for next week
try compiling main.c using the following command:

```
$ gcc -Wall main.c
```
-Wall is an option flag that means "all warnings" get displayed; we'll address those warnings next week.

also, be thinking about how we could make these programs more dynamic by asking for user input...
