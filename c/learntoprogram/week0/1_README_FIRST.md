**look at the code in main.c.**

type out that code (don't copy-paste!) into the verison of main.c that you made on your computer (from the [Intro](https://github.com/austinjalexander/learntoprogram)).

with your terminal open and pointing at the directory wher your version of main.c is located, to compile, type the following in the terminal:

```
$ gcc main.c
```

if you see errors displayed in the terminal by the compiler, attempt to fix your program; if no errors are reported, to run the executable file that the compiler created, do the following in your terminal:

```
$ ./a.out
```

hopefully, you see the successful output of your program! Now start trying the assignments, and repeat the above commands when you're ready.

**by the way:** each week, there will be files in a directory called *code_compare* that will show you how the same ideas implemented in the C program can be implemented in C++, Java, and Javascript.

if we make it beyond programming basics, familiarity with the syntax of these other languages will be helpful (for many reasons, but also) since we'll make use of at least one of them for future tutorials and assignments that focus on object-oriented programming.
