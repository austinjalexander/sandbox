#include <stdio.h>

// Welcome to a C file

// the two forward slashes "//" mean that any line with them
// is a comment

// i'll use comments to explain stuff

main() {
  // let's say you want to print something out
  // so that your user will see it display on their terminal;
  // here's one way to do it:

  printf("hello, world\n");
}

// NOTE:
/* this 
 * is
 * a multiline 
 comment; it's good practice to have * on every line 
 even though you
 don't need to have them; it makes it easier for people
 to see that your comment is continuing
 *
 */
 
 /*
  * so much better
  * this way
  *
  */
  
/****** ALSO!!! ******/
// that "include" statement at the top of the
// file basically grabs pre-made code for you;
// it's what makes the printf() work (among other things)
